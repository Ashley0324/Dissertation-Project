# 👗Virtual Fitting Rooms System Design
## Introduction
### 💨Problem Statement

Are you tired of being tired to try clothes again and again😮‍?  Every time I go to a cloth shop, I spend almost one hour in the fitting room, undressing, getting dressed, what a time-wasting activity. Besides, shops have to arrange extra space for these fitting rooms. Absolutely, it's a meaningful product in during the pandemic.

💡So, if I can **try on clothes without wasting time in an AR environment**, why not?

### 🔎 Research Question
I'm trying to apply **AR and AI** technology to build a virtual fitting room, which allows users to place the item over live imaging of the customer to **check the size, style, and fit of products** they’re thinking of buying.

### 🚩Functions
- Get real environment images.
- Allow user to place clothes on in an AR environment.
- Use gesture recognition to control the system.
- Check the size and give suggestions(like, size 6 is more suitable).

### 🧱Hardware needed
- A mirror(actually, a digital screen), maybe I could use an iPhone or iPad to replace it.
- Camera(If I use a digital device with a camera, I don't need an exstra one).
- Device that can generate user body model.

### 📊Data needed
- User body model information
- Clothes model with specific mearsurement and size

### 💻Technology
- Augmented reality (AR): allow users try on clothes without touching 
- Gesture recognition: allow users control this system conviniently
- ? Mobile system architecture: I'd like to build an application based on Android,but I'm not sure about it.
